  <h1>College of Health Sciences Advising Needs Assessment</h1>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
The College of Health Sciences at the University of Delaware has a number of
fast-growing departments, with two listed in the top 5 largest on campus, Nursing
and Kinesiology and Applied Physiology. The majors prepare students for careers
in the health care field, or further graduate study in the health professions,
which makes these majors extremely popular due to the high number of jobs and the
starting salary for health care practioners.
</p>
<p>
  The College utilizes professional advisors to focus on academic planning and
  preparation for admission to graduate programs, especially in the first couple
  years of their program, but also to ensure that each student receives the correct
  and most updated information on policy and procedure when it comes to degree
  completion. The University is moving in the direction of having professional
  advisors in every department, however, the College of Health Sciences has already
  moved to this model for all departments.
</p>
<p>
  For my needs assessment, I plan to focus on what the College of Health Sciences
  is doing, through surveys from advisors, faculty, and students, and determine
  what would need to change in order for the advising process to improve and service
  more students. I also intend to back my suggestions with research on best practices
  and academic advising theory. I would hope this assessment could also be applied
  to other departments and colleges at the University who wish to move towards a
  professional advising model.
