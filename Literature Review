  <h1>Literature Review</h1>
  <h2>Technology in Academic Advising</h2>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>As part of my needs assessment for Academic Advising in the College of Health
    Sciences at the University of Delaware, I want to look at how technology can
    help advisors connect with more students as well as help collect data to better
    service the needs of students enrolled in our programs. I plan to use real-time
    survey data to devise a needs assessment, but the following review of literature
     discusses incorporation of technology that I believe I may see in the survey results.

<p><em>Educause Center for Analysis and Research Study of Undergraduate Students
  and Information Technology, 2016<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup></em>
<p>ECAR does a larger research study every few years of how undergraduate students
interact with and use technology in their courses and personal lives. It takes
an inventory of what devices they use as well as how, when, where, and why they
use it. I found it very interesting that tablet use has been going down for a
number of years while laptop usage is at an all-time high of 95%. Smartphones are
on the rise in classroom settings as well. I found the most interesting part of
the article to start on page 20, under the Technology Preferences of Students chapter.
The research discusses how students relate to technology, and there are four main
points they highlight. Students like how technology can enable them to connect
with course material in non-traditional ways. Sometimes this is by watching a
lecture rather than attending class, but a majority found it helpful to be able to
connect with course material outside of the classroom for review or enhancement
purposes. Students truly believe they should possess the necessary skills to navigate
through various technologies, and appreciated an opportunity to learn more about this.
A large group of students mentioned not being familiar with or adequately prepared
to use the campus technology they had to interact with, such as library databases,
registration software, etc. I think technology would be a great topic to interweave
into our First Year Seminar courses. Currently these courses touch upon digital
citizenship, but do not go beyond that as far as learning to use the different
technologies available on campus or even showing students what is available to
them as a student at UD. Most of the students in the study also found that technology
was something that excited and empowered them. It's encouraging to know that students
enjoy using technology, and I think that means it will be even easier to incorporate
it into our advising procedures and communication plan. This could also encourage
faculty to bring it into their coursework even more, and maybe add some excitement
into their course material. Lastly, there was a small group of students who were
uncomfortable with opening themselves to the internet. Although it's a small group,
we would have to take into consideration that some students may be unsure of sharing
personal, academic, information online, so we could not completely remove a face-to-face
option for this group. Finally, I think this study proves that if technology resources
were incorporated into our advising plan students would be very receptive to it,
and would have access to the resources needed to interact with advisors through
technological resources.

<p><em>Academic advising via Facebook: Examining student help seeking<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup></em>
<p>The article follows an experiment an advisor did with a small group of students
using Facebook as a means to connect with the academic advisor. The advisor selected
6 students from their cohort and asked them if they would like to connect with
him on Facebook. He then created an advisor account and followed these six students,
and the students followed the advisor account. The advisor was able to see student
posts about being stressed about a course, or if they experienced a positive moment
in their academic life, and respond in the appropriate way. The students were able
to reach out easily and quickly, through a medium they were already on all the
time, to ask quick, impersonal questions. The advisor was also able to share information
with the students regarding deadlines, upcoming events, or interesting reading
material. The students appreciated the additional access to the advisor, and the
advisor appreciated having an outlet to increase help seeking from students. The
biggest issue with using Facebook is it requires the students to accept the friend
request of the advisor. Students who are the hardest to reach may not seek out an
advisor on Facebook if they are not seeking out the advisor's help in person either.
The sample size was also very small, so it may not be as successful on a larger scale,
or may require more time of the advisor that they do not have available. I think
the small success of this experiment shows us that students would like to have
access to an advisor on a platform they interact with on a regular basis. I think
this also shows how there are multiple ways to share information with students
and to start building in these resources into our regular communication strategies.

<p><em>Improving Advising Using Technology and Data Analytics<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup></em>
<p>This paper discussed how Arizona State University implemented its eAdvisor software
into their campus advising practices. Many of the tools in eAdvisor are already
available here at UD through UDSIS and now the new Blue Hen Success Collaborative.
We have tools to connect students to different resources on campus, see information
about the student from various sources, record conversations and notes about meetings,
and use data from student grades and success rates to determine how a student may
do in their intended major. This information is very readily available to students
and advisors to use, however the biggest issue is teaching users how to use the
information and empowering students to use it on their own in planning their academic
careers, and for advisors to learn how to read the data collected to guide the
conversations they have with students. This could be worked into the First Year
Seminar course which I outlined in the previous review, or it could be done in
the first few advising meetings a student has. If it is to be done during advisement
meetings, it may be helpful to require at least one advisement appointment for
all new students in their first semester.

 <p><em>Evaluating Your College's Readiness for Technology Adoption<sup><a href="#ref1">4</a></sup></em>
<p>This is a great self-assessment tool created by the Community College Research Center
to help a college assess what they made need to do in order to handle a change or
increase in technology implementation on their campus. The paper goes through different
points that should be considered and a matrix to determine level of readiness.
I think this would be a great tool to employ when starting to put together a potential
technology plan and to determine if a need in the assessment would be possible.
